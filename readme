Started with gulp angular generator, using bootstrap for css.

Decided to create different controllers and templates for each functionality -- login/register/forgot,
mainly for practice. I'm assuming the thing to do is to create a service that manages logged in status,
and I could use some additional experience interacting with services passed around among different controllers.
I'm not yet sure how I should simply emulate a backend . . . I'm thinking either a text file, or just defining an array of possibly values
within the service.

My approach is to build it using methods that I think will work, and after building I will compare with https://github.com/mrgamer/angular-login-example to see methodology. I know I've at least
stumbled across things created by mrgamer before, so hopefully his approach can help.
